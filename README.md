Language extinctions calculation and endangered languages of the world
In this project the main goal was to create a database with as many languages and dialects as possible and then to calculate which features were making them more and more endangered until the extinction point.
Machine learning came in very handy for this purpose, as I wanted to create an app that calculates if a language, given certain values, would also be in the same position of others with the same values and features.

In the app you can find a database and a Tableau dashboard that help navigating and finding relevant information for your own research.
The app is mainly thought for researchers (linguists for example) who may have difficulties in finding materials about these languages.

The user experience seems good enough for researches to enjoy their navigation, therefore I hope you will enjoy using it.
